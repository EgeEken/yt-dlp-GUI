# yt-dlp GUI
### A simple tkinter-based GUI for yt-dlp

I made this for myself because I finally decided I didn't wanna bother with the command line interface anymore, and all the GUI wrappers I saw online had kinda convoluted install requirements.

Don't get me wrong, for someone without python installed, so would this one, it's just that since I do have all the dependencies installed i can just run this directly so making a short simple script was easier than installing another one.
